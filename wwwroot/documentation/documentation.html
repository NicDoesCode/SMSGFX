        <h1>SMSGFX Documentation</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome to SMSGFX!</strong> This documentation will assist you with performing simple tasks
            associated with the product.</p>

        <h3>What is SMSGFX?</h3>
        <p>SMSGFX is a browser based tile editor that allows you to make graphics for Sega Master System and Sega Game
            Gear.</p>
        <p>You can import graphics from image files, the clipboard, assembly code or simply draw something from scratch,
            and when you're done you can export the graphics in a format that the Sega Master System and Game Gear
            understands.</p>
        <p>Projects are automatically saved in your browser as you work, you can load and save projects from files.</p>

        <h3>Concepts</h3>
        <h5>Projects</h5>
        <p>SMSGFX works with objects called "Projects", a project is a container for the colour palettes and graphics
            tiles that you've defined.</p>
        <h5>Palette</h5>
        <p>The Sega Master System and Game Gear use palettes with 16 colour slots per palette. Each slot contains the
            RGB
            value for a colour. You can use the same colour in multiple slots.</p>
        <p>When you paint an image it is important to note that each 'pixel' does not store a colour, but instead it
            stores the slot number of the colour used from 1 to 16. You will notice that as you change colour palettes
            the colours in your image will also update to reflect the colour palette used.</p>
        <h5>Colours</h5>
        <p>The Sega Master System uses 6-bit colour, this gives you a total count of 64 colours that you can use with
            your graphics, this limited amount of colours gives Master System games their signature bright and cartoony
            look.</p>
        <p>The Sega Game Gear uses 12-bit colour, this gives you a total count of 4096 colours that you can use with
            your graphics, this expanded range of colours allows you to pick more complementary colours than the Master
            System.</p>
        <p>Despite the total colours available to you remember that you may only use 16 of these colours per palette
            meaning that each tile may show a maximum of 16 colours.</p>
        <h5>Tiles</h5>
        <p>The Sega Master System and Game Gear construct their graphics using a mosaic of 8x8 pixel tiles.</p>
        <p>To construct a scene we lay out these tiles out in a 'tile map'. You can not draw on individual
            pixels on these systems, your scene is constructed from these tiles.</p>
        <p>In almost all games a single tile is repeated multiple times.</p>
        <h5>Tile map</h5>
        <p>This is a grid constructed of individual 8x8 graphics tiles that you define. Each tile may be repeated
            any number of times. Each entry in a tile map also tells the system which colour palette to use and
            whether the tile is to be flipped horizontally or vertically, or appear on-top of or behind sprites.</p>
        <p>You cannot place a tile anywhere on the screen, each tile must be placed into a tile map.</p>
        <h5>Sprite</h5>
        <p>A sprite is a single 8x8 tile from your tile set, unlike a tile map, a sprite may be moved to any position
            onto the screen.</p>
        <p>In a game, usually the player's character is a sprite, depending on the size of the player's character,
            several tiles and sprites may be used to act as one large sprite.</p>
        <p>There are limitations on sprites, with only 64 allowed at once, and no more than 8 can appear side by side,
            if there are more than 8 side by side you will experience flickering graphics.</p>
        <h5>Tile set</h5>
        <p>A tile set is a concept used by SMSGFX which refers to the entire collection of tiles for your project
            regardless of the tile map that they're used on.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <h4>Creating a new project</h4>
        <p>The first time that you use the app on a new browser a new project will be automatically created and opened
            for you.</p>
        <p>With this project you can start drawing and customising palettes right away, however you might also want top
            bring in graphics from image files or
        </p>
